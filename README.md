<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Pixema is the final graduation project of the TechMeSkills course in front-end development. There are no online movies on this site. The purpose of this site: to provide an opportunity to decide for yourself with good films, series, anime. It is possible to search for a movie by title and filter by year of release. In order not to lose your favorite movie or series, you can use the user's personal account by going through a simple registration using e-mail. After that, adding to favorites will become available, as well as changing the theme of the site.
